 <h1>The Best Movies According to Alessandro Prieto Lopez </h1>
    <h2> My top 3 movies of all-time:</h2>
 <hr />
        <h3> Interestellar </h3>
        <p>
            I like this movie becuase its very sad and it explains
            how time dilation work. It combines science fiction and
            also combines emotions, which is really cool.
          </p>
        <h3>Forrest Gump</h3>
        <p>I also like this movie very much because its also emotive and its 
            sort of comedy but at the same time sad.
        </p>
        <h3> The Dark Knight</h3>
            <p> This movie is one of my all time favorites, because it includes 
                a character that I like very much, which is the joker, the acting 
                on this movie is insane and its really entertaining.
